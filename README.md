# qRT-PCR 

### Process You qRT-PCR Results Easy  
====


     
These python programs aim at calculating the **Delta_Ct, Delta_Delta_Ct and FoldChange** value which
produced by Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction.
    
**Pandas**, a python data analysis tool, is required for using this script.

**Matplotlib**, a python plotting interface to Matlab, is required for generate plots.
    
The following file formats are supported: **xls, xlsx, csv, txt**. 
    
In addition, your should specify **reference control** name and **expriment control** name for your own data sets.
    
For **ABi 7900** users, data column names must be 'Sample Name','Detector Name','Ct','Ct Mean'. But 'Ct StdEV' is optional.

For **ABi ViiA 7** users, you can use qpcrRead.py to extract data computing results directly.

##Useage

Python2.7 or Python3 users

#####Before use this module, see help
python qpcrRead.py -h 

python qpcrCalculate.py -h


####Parameters

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                          show this help message and exit
  
  -f FILE, --file FILE                the file you want to analysis.
  
  -s SHEET, --sheetName SHEET         the sheet name of your excel file you want to analysis
  
  --header HEAD                       header row you want to start with
  
  --tail TAIL                         the tail rows of your excel file you want to drop
  
  -r RC, --referenceControl RC        the reference gene name of your sample, e.g. GAPDH
  
  -c EC, --experimentalControl EC     the control group name which your want to compare, e.g. hESC
  
  -o OUT, --outFileNamePrefix OUT     the output file name
  
  --version                           show program's version number and exit

#####Extract Data from Original Data output
**e.g.** python qpcrRead.py -f foo.xls --header 35 --tail 5  -o 20150625_NPC_Knockdown

#####Calculate Detal_Ct, Delta_Delta_Ct, Fold_Change and generate output file
To run this program sucessfully, please use output file which is generated by qpcrRead.py

In addition, you can reshape your own data structure the same as testDataSet.txt

**e.g.** python qpcrCalculte.py -f foo.csv -r GAPDH -c hESC -o 20150625_NPC_Knockdown

#####Generate Plots: line, bar plot
To Do

##To Do List

1. process data automatically without pre-filter outliner mannully.
2. Generate Plots using Matplotlib automatically 
3. Generate Matplotlib Plotting Scripts for customized modification
