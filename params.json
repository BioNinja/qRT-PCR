I use Ipython as my interpreter.\r\n    \r\n    For using this scirpt, sample name and detector name(genes that you want to detect) should be the same with your data sets. You can modify by yourself as desired.\r\n    \r\n    You need to specify the file path and file format mannually if your have different file source, like txt et. al.\r\n    \r\n    In addition, your should specify internal control name and expriment control name for your own data sets.\r\n    \r\n    Last but not least, your data set struture need to be the same as my trainning data set.That's to say, column names must be 'Sample Name','Detector Name','Ct','Ct Mean'. But 'Ct StdEV' is optional. After this, you can get robust analsis.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
